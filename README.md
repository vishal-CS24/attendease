## Overview

Welcome to the Attendance System using Machine Learning with the LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm. This project empowers teachers to streamline the process of managing student attendance using the power of computer vision and machine learning. With this system, you can effortlessly:

- Enter student details in the student section.
- Capture student photos through your camera.
- Train the LBPH model for facial recognition.
- Take attendance using your webcam and automatically record it in an Excel file.
